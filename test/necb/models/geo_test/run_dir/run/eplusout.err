   ************* ===== Final Error Summary =====
   ************* The following error categories occurred.  Consider correcting or noting.
   ************* Loads Initialization did not Converge
   ************* ..1) very high thermal mass such as very thick concrete (solution: increase max number of warmup
   ************* ..   days in the BUILDING object);
   ************* ..2) moderate mass and inadequate space conditioning such that the building keeps getting warmer
   ************* ..   and warmer on successive days (solution: add HVAC, check building thermal properties,
   ************* ..   check if infiltration is included, make sure HVAC properly controlled);
   ************* ..3) a soil layer modeled below the concrete slab - (solution remove this layer and read about
   ************* ..   ground temperatures in the Auxiliary Programs document).
   ************* ..4) unreasonable (too small) limits in the BUILDING object for temperature (.4 default) or
   ************* ..   loads tolerances (.04 default)
   ************* Nominally Unused Constructions
   ************* ..The nominally unused constructions warning is provided to alert you to potential conditions that can cause
   ************* ..extra time during simulation. Each construction is calculated by the algorithm indicated in the HeatBalanceAlgorithm
   ************* ..object. You may remove the constructions indicated (when you use the DisplayExtraWarnings option).
